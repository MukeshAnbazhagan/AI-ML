Cardiac arrhythmia, in simple terms, is an abnormal electrical activity of the heart. The abnormality can be either with the rate, rhythm, sequence of conduction or origin of conduction. Arrhythmias are classified easily based on the heart rate. Normal heart rate is between 60-100 beats per minutes but it can be high during vigorous physical activities such as running or exercising or can be lower during rest. Heart rate and rhythm must be normal to ensure proper delivery of oxygen rich blood to all organs of the body. Cardiac conduction system is a group of cells that control the speed and rhythm of each and every heartbeat with the help of electrical impulses. Problems in this conduction system gives rise to Arrhythmia.  This project uses the MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital) arrhythmia database to classify different types of Arrhythmias beats and detect the type of Arrhythmia by using Machine Learning (KNN, SVM and Random Forest) and Deep Learning (ANN and CNN) algorithms and the PTB-DB (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt) database for a general analysis on the type of heart beats.
